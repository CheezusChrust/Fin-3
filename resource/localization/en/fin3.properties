# If you add a new fin type, add it here with the name it has in the models table
tool.fin3.fintype.flat=Flat Plate
tool.fin3.fintype.flat.info=Flat plates stall at a very low AoA (around 5 degrees), and have much higher drag than conventional airfoils when at any AoA higher than 0. Generally not recommended for most aircraft as flat plates have poor flight characteristics.

tool.fin3.fintype.symmetrical=Symmetrical
tool.fin3.fintype.symmetrical.info=Symmetrical airfoils do not produce lift at 0 AoA, and can resist stalling up to around 15 degrees. They have equal performance for negative and positive AoAs, so are recommended for control surfaces.

tool.fin3.fintype.cambered=Cambered
tool.fin3.fintype.cambered.info=Cambered airfoils produce a lifting force at 0 AoA, and can resist stalling up to around 15 degrees. Recommended for the main wing of an aircraft as it has much better performance with a positive AoA.\nThe zero lift angle determines the negative AoA at which the wing produces no lift.

tool.fin3.name=Fin 3
tool.fin3.desc=Turn any prop into a simulated fin
tool.fin3.left=Create or update a fin - first click defines the up axis when creating a new fin
tool.fin3.right=Copy fin settings
tool.fin3.reload=Remove fin from prop
tool.fin3.centeroflift=(Hold SPRINT) Calculate the center of lift of the vehicle

tool.fin3.stage1.definefwd=Define the fin's forward vector based on your aim position
tool.fin3.stage1.definefwd2=(Hold SPRINT) Define the fin's forward vector based on the hit normal of the tooled surface
tool.fin3.stage1.reload=Cancel fin creation

tool.fin3.info=Important Info!\n\"Angle of Attack\", or AoA, refers to the angle of the fin compared to the angle of the airflow.\n\nIf the AoA is too high, the fin will begin to stall, and subsequently lose lift and gain drag.

tool.fin3.fintype=Airfoil Type
tool.fin3.fintype.specificsettings=Airfoil Settings
tool.fin3.fintype.specificsettings.zeroliftangle=Zero Lift Angle

tool.fin3.efficiency=Efficiency Mul
tool.fin3.efficiency.info=Calculated lift and drag forces are multiplied by this value. Base lift and drag are determined by the surface area of the fin. A value of 1 is closest to real life.

tool.fin3.induceddrag=Induced Drag Mul
tool.fin3.induceddrag.info=Induced drag is a byproduct of lift, and is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the fin. A fin with a long span and short chord, like on a glider, will have a high aspect ratio and thus low induced drag. This slider multiplies the final induced drag coefficient.

tool.fin3.advanced=Advanced Settings
tool.fin3.advanced.lowpass=Low-pass Filter
tool.fin3.advanced.lowpass.info=Enable this if your contraption starts shaking violently in certain situations. This will make the calculations more stable, but less accurate. Mostly needed on low mass, high surface area/high speed contraptions.

tool.fin3.debug=Debug Displays
tool.fin3.debug.showvectors=Display lift/drag vectors
tool.fin3.debug.showforces=Display lift/drag force values

tool.fin3_propeller.name=Fin 3 - Propeller
tool.fin3_propeller.desc=Turn any prop into a simulated propeller
tool.fin3_propeller.left=Convert a prop into a propeller or update an existing propeller
tool.fin3_propeller.right=Copy propeller settings
tool.fin3_propeller.reload=Remove propeller from prop

tool.fin3_propeller.bladecount=Blade Count
tool.fin3_propeller.bladecount.info=The number of blades on the propeller.
tool.fin3_propeller.diameter=Diameter
tool.fin3_propeller.diameter.info=The diameter of the propeller, in meters.
tool.fin3_propeller.bladepitch=Blade Pitch
tool.fin3_propeller.bladepitch.info=The pitch of the blades, in degrees.\n90 degrees is feathered (minimal forwards drag).\nA low (fine) pitch allows for good acceleration and climb rate, while a high (coarse) pitch is more efficient at high speeds.
tool.fin3_propeller.invert=Invert Rotation
tool.fin3_propeller.invert.info=Inverts the rotation direction of the propeller (counter clockwise when viewed from behind).
tool.fin3_propeller.debuginfo=Display propeller debug info
